# bitmex chrome extension

## installation

TODO

## description

- this chrome extension will allow you to see uPnL and PnL in USD terms, rather than just XBT

## known bugs

- doesn't work correctly with non-XBT pairs at the moment, since it's using the current price found in each open position's row
